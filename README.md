- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @KseniaVeselova
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Data Analysis (Python, SQL)

Junior Data analyst/scientist.
In June 2022 I completed Yandex data analyst professional training course.
During my previous experience I realized how essential the data is.

I really enjoy to research and investigate problems by using data.
It encouraged me to take the Data Analyst professional training course offered by Yandex.

I 'd like to develop as a data specialist and looking for new opportunities in the data analysis field. I am ready to put in a lot of effort to become a good specialist in this field.
