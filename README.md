- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @KseniaVeselova
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Data Analysis (Python, SQL, BigQuery and others)

Junior Data analyst/scientist.
In June 2022 I completed Yandex data analyst professional training course (350 hours).
During my previous experience I worked with data which recived from construction side. I worked as BIM-manager.

I really enjoy to research and investigate problems by using data.
It encouraged me to take the Data Analyst professional training course offered by Yandex.

I'd like to develop as a data specialist and looking for new opportunities in the data analysis field. 

In June I got a one-month internship in a Swedish company named Health Integrator and passed it successfully. During internship I learnt a new tool â€“ Google Data Studio.
